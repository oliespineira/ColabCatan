# Simplified Catan - Algorithms Project

This is a simplified version of the Settlers of Catan board game, built to demonstrate various algorithms and data structures.

## Project Structure

- `model/` - Basic data structures (hexes, vertices, edges, players, bank)
- `engine/` - Main game engine that controls turns and flow
- `rules/` - Rules checking (distance rule, connectivity, etc.)
- `services/` - Game services (production, trading, building, etc.)
- `search/` - Pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest path)
- `tests/` - Unit tests for all components

## Algorithms & Data Structures We'll Use

1. **Arrays & Sequential Search** - Storing tiles, searching through lists
2. **Basic Sorting** - Organizing resources, players by score
3. **Linked Lists** - Connecting vertices and edges
4. **Recursion** - Finding longest road paths
5. **Binary Search** - Finding best building locations
6. **Quicksort & Mergesort** - Sorting leaderboards
7. **Stacks & Queues** - Development cards, trade offers
8. **Multidimensional Arrays** - Board layout
9. **Hash Tables & Sets** - Fast lookups, tracking ownership
10. **Trees & Traversals** - Board structure
11. **DFS vs BFS** - Pathfinding and connectivity
12. **Binary Search Trees** - Organizing buildable locations
13. **Heaps & Priority Queues** - Turn order, pathfinding

## Getting Started

Run `python main.py` to start the game
